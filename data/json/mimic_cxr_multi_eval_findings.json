The present image covers the line only about 5 inches below the hiatal area. The more distal portion of the line could be followed further on the previous chest examination, still the tip of the Dobbhoff line was never included in the image. Precise location of the line is essential for patient's management. It is recommended to perform the study under fluoroscopic control. Comparison of the chest examinations does not reveal any new acute infiltrate. However, the pulmonary vascular pattern appears to be crowded, probably related to the high positioned diaphragms."

No pneumothorax identified in right apical area. A right internal jugular approach central venous line remains similar as on the preceding study."
